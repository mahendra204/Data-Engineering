# DATA PIPELINES----DATA ENGINEERING
gathered data from open source website and loaded into a local machine and started building pipeline where i need to build a pipe line from one source file to another folder. 

I need to extract the data and transform it into different fileters like i filtered june month data and the weekend would be saturday data. we can apply many transformations. 

I changed column of date time to perticular formats and converted all columns into upper cases. This is just sample data pipelines where i have used a simple file with 35k records.

In real world scenarios the underlying principle would be same but the handling of data would be large and we can handle it with help of spark as it works as big data framework to handle large amount of data.

But we can apply many transformations as we can its all depending upon the requirements which we have to make data scientist and ml engineers make them work easy and to do well predictions by feature engineering and all we can do as a data engineers.
